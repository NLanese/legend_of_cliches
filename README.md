# Legend_Of_Cliches In-Browser Game

This project will be hosted by a React/Redux structure and supported with a Ruby on Rails backend. Upon running the file using 'npm start,' a new window will open in your default browser, prompting the user to either...

Start a New Game

Load a Saved game (by logging in using either OAuth or signing in manually using the has_secure_password attribute of rails)

or

Check the Options and Settings of the game

Once started, the game will be a 2D top-down RPG. Users can create an avatar based off of one of three classes, and then customize it to their own wishes as each class will have a customizable attributes such as attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed, and health; they will also be able to have four active attacks out of over 80 total made attack objects. 
Each section of the game, or each "map," will be rendered by a massive two-dimensional array, with each element containing an object. This object will contain an image that will be rendered in a div, as well as details about the space such as whether its occupied by a player, enemy, NPC, or obstacle. 
This two dimensional array will then have each of its elements mapped out to a div in such a manner that [0,1]'s object will be placed in the div to the top left of the grid and [200, 50]'s object will be placed in the bottom right. The images in each div/object will work as such so that [0,1] and [0,2] are right next to each other with no whitespace in between.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
